Integrated Probabilistic Risk Assessment Example for ATSDR

Tetra Tech was contracted to ATSDR to explore how integrated probabilistic risk assessment methods can be applied to public health assessments. This repository contains publicly available data and draft code supporting the report.

Two additional files are required for Exposure Duration variability: the "AHS 2015 National PUF 3.0 SAS" and the "AHS 2017 National PUF 3.0 SAS" datasets. They are too large to upload to this repository, but can be downloaded from this site: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data.html.
